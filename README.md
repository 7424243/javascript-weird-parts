## Vocabulary

* Syntax Parser: a translator program/compiler that reads your code and determines what it does and if it is valid for the computer. If not, it sometimes adds extra stuff before sending to the computer.

* Lexical Environment: where something sits physically in the code is important. The syntax parser really cares about this!

* Execution Context: a wrapper to help manage the code that is currently running/the specific lexical environment that is currently running. It includes the global object/window object, the 'this' object, outer environment, and the code.
